      <h2>So What Is This About?</h2>
      <p><b>T</b>here is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. Talos aims to excite, inspire,
        and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. The HTML
        remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.</p>
      <p><b>C</b>SS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated
      in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once theD reins are placed in the hands
      of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web;
      we can always push it further.</p>

      <h2>Requeriments</h2>
      <p><b>W</b>here possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong
      fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Talos Digital is about functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge
      tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your CSS validates.</p>
      <p><b>L</b>uckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to
      the sheer number of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts
       may not be possible across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in
       at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
      <p><b>W</b>e ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past
      the point of needing another talos-related design.</p>
